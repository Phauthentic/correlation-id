## Documentation

### Correlation ID

The correlation ID is a singleton class that will always return the same ID for the current life-cycle of the request.

### Middleware

The middleware will automatically put the correlation ID into your request object as attribute and header value. By default both use the `CorrelationID` name.

```
$middleware = new CorrelationIDMiddleware(
    CorrelationID::toString()
);
```

### Response

Since there is no standard for where this needs to be done, just add the correlation ID to your response where ever it suits your architecture or framework.

```php
$response->withHeader('CorrelationID', CorrelationId::toString());
```
