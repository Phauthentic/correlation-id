## Documentation

### Correlation ID

The correlation id is a singleon class that will always return the same id for the current life-cycle of the request.

### Middleware

The middleware will automatically put the correlation id into your request object as attribute and header value. By default both use the `CorrelationId` name. 

```
$middleware = new CorrelationIdMiddleware(
    CorrelationId::toString()
); 
```

### Response

Since there is no standard for where this needs to be done, just add the correlation id to your response where ever it suits your architecture or framework. 

```php
$response->withHeader('CorrelationId', CorrelationId::toString());
```
